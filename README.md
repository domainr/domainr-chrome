## Development

You'll need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed.

Set your `DOMAINR_CHROME_API_KEY` environment variable. For instance, in the Mac terminal (assuming bash):

    export DOMAINR_CHROME_API_KEY=foo

* `npm install` to install dependencies
* `gulp build` to build the code.
* `gulp watch` to watch the code, building on changes.
* `gulp` builds + watch, and runs the demo in a webpage.
